    "<b>Confidentiality Statement</b><br> As the organizers of this contest, we assure all participants that their submitted models and code will be treated with strict confidentiality. Submissions will only be accessed by the designated review team for evaluation purposes and will not be shared, distributed, or used beyond the scope of this challenge. Participants retain full ownership of their work. We will not claim any rights over the submitted materials, nor will we use them for any purpose outside of the challenge evaluation process. We appreciate your participation in this challenge.\n",

    "#### How to create your submission\n",
    "- Get familiar with the existing code blocks and the example provided below.\n",
    "- Set the root path of your environment and your dataset below (\"TODO: DEFINE YOUR PATHS HERE.\").\n",
    "- Set up your project (\"TODO: SETUP YOUR PROJECT HERE.\").\n",
    "- Implement the retrieval interface below (\"TODO: ADD YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE.\").\n",
    "    - Use the provided helper functions (helpers) to download your source code, model checkpoints, etc.\n",
    "- Instantiate your retrieval model (\"TODO: INSTANTIATE YOUR MODEL HERE.\").\n",
    "- Before **submitting your notebook**, run this notebook in a clean conda environment (with python >= 3.10) on Ubuntu 24.04 and make sure the evaluation results are in line with your previous results.\n",
    "- Submit your notebooks and the technical report as described on our [website](https://qvim-aes.github.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some Rules\n",
    "- DO NOT modify the other code cells.\n",
    "- DO NOT add new cells.\n",
    "- Store your project WITHIN 'ROOT_PATH' and your data within 'DATA_PATH'.\n",
    "- DO NOT use 'ROOT_PATH/output' folder; this is where we will store things.\n",
    "- DO NOT change the working directory (e.g., `os.chdir('/path/to/a/dir/that/does/not/exist/on/my/machine')`).\n",
    "- DO NOT use system commands (`!cd ~` or `os.system('cd ~')`, etc.) other than the ones used to set up your environment (i.e., install required packages with pip, conda, ...).\n",
